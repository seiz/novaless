# Less Extension for Nova
Compiles .less files into .css files on save (to the same location as the .less file).

## Requirements
lessc

The easiest is to install lessc with npm:

- Install node/npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (i.e.: https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.4/node-v12.18.4.pkg)
- Install less: In a Terminal, type: `sudo npm install -g less`
- By default, lessc is executed from `/usr/local/bin/lessc` if you installed it at a different location, you can set the "executable path" in the extension's preferences.
